Two things here are load-bearing rather than cosmetic:

* **`pos_weight` on the stationary BCE.** Stationary windows are only 3.3-6.2%
  of each split. Unweighted BCE is minimised by predicting "moving" everywhere,
  which scores ~95% accuracy and learns nothing. The weight is the measured
  negative/positive ratio.
* **The smoothness term is session-scoped.** Consecutive windows overlap by 9 s
  and are 1 s apart, so their displacements really are near-continuous — but
  only within one session. Applied across a session boundary it would penalise
  a discontinuity that physically exists.
